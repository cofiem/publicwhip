We didn’t. A person’s stance on a [Policy](#policies) is determined by how they voted in parliament in [Divisions](#division) that relate to that Policy. In other words—it doesn’t matter what they say, it’s how they voted that counts.

However we might not have the full picture and you can help fix that. Here’s how it works:

1. After creating a Policy on <%= inline_project_name %>, we need to find [Divisions](/divisions) that relate to that [Policy](/policies) and work out how someone who supported it would have voted.

2. Once a Division is connected to a Policy, <%= inline_project_name %> uses each person’s vote to calculate a where they stand compared to how a supporter would have voted—you can easily see these details and get a technical explanation by clicking through to an individual person on a Policy’s page.

There are thousands of Divisions on <%= inline_project_name %>. There are bound to be some we haven’t yet connected to Policies. You can help improve the accuracy of <%= inline_project_name %> by finding and classifying more Divisions for the Policies you care about.
